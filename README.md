# ALIEN GAME
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
This project is a video game developed as the Final Project for the CS50x course. 
It is an improved version of the 1st exercise of the course (Week 0) developed with Scratch.  
(https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1065060280)

In this video game, a speceman is being chased by a xenomorph inside a spaceship. The user controls the spaceman, 
it can be moved up/down/left/right with the '↑''↓''←''→' keys. The spaceman, pressing 's' key can shoot a laser.
At the begining of the game, spaceman has 100 lifepoints and the alien has 10.
When the alien is being shot, it looses a lifepoint. But when the alien reaches the spaceman, spaceman looses 
his lifepoints.
If either the spaceman or the alien reaches 0 lifepoint, the game ends. 

The project contains several files:
    - 'alien_v1.py', it is the main script that runs the game. 
    - 'testing.py', this is a simple script that allowed me to test differents images, a jump animation for the spaceman,
or where to display my text. 
    - 'test_font.py', this code can be reused for any pygame project. It displays all the fonts available in pygame. 
    - 'best_time.txt', this file store the shortest time the user took to eliminate the alien. 
    - 'sup.otf', the font used for the title of the game
    - the media folder contains music, images for the characters and the backgrounds, 'win.png' and 'game_over2.png' are 
original images created with ChatGPT! Other images and musics have been found on the internet.
